# noshowappointment-analysis
This is my first project in the Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree program

# Dataset
This dataset collects information from more than 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on whether or not patients show up for their medical appointments. The analysis will be based on analyzing the different reasons that could have influenced the patients to show up for their appointment or not show up. The data features incude PatientId, AppointmentID, Gender, ScheduledDay, AppointmentDay, Age, SMS_received and some other additional variables.

# Summary of Findings
In this analysis, I found out that Female go to hospital more than male as the percent is 65%. We see the number of patient who go with scholarship is 10%. The percentage of patient who have hipertension is 20% which is the most commn disease in patients. The percentage of patient who have diabetes is 7%. The percentage of patient who have alcoholism 3% which is the less comm0n disease. The percentage of patient who have SMS_received?is 32%. we can see that 20% of the scheduled appointment were not attended by patients.

It can be deduced that the % of No-Show in Females is almost as double as the % of No-Show in Males. The count of Male with No-show = 7,512 of total males with a percentage = 35% of Males patients The count of Female with No-show = 14,392 of total females with a percentage = 65% of Females patients. so both male and female showed up greatly for their appointment.

Being with chronic condition does not affect the No-Show percentage that is to say that having hipertension or not is not a reason for not showing up for appoinments in the hospital.
